"""
Redundant Execution for Fault Tolerance (Priority 5)
====================================================

Executes 2+ identical agents in parallel for reliability.

Problem Solved:
- APIs time out, models crash, networks drop
- Single point of failure causes entire operation to fail
- Long-tail latency causes unpredictable user experience

Benefits:
- 33% reliability improvement (60% → 80% success rate in article)
- Eliminates long-tail latency events
- Zero additional latency (parallel execution)
- Graceful degradation under adverse conditions

Based on: "Building the 14 Key Pillars of Agentic AI" - Pillar 9

Example Use:
    executor = RedundantExecutor(num_copies=2)
    result = executor.execute(unreliable_api_call, "user_data")
    # If first copy fails or times out, second copy provides result
    # Success: 80% vs 60% for single execution

    Redundant Execution System for Fault Tolerance.

    Executes 2+ identical agents/functions in parallel and uses
    the result from the first to successfully finish.

    Architecture:
        1. Scatter: Dispatch N identical tasks in parallel
        2. Race: Wait for first successful completion
        3. Cancel: Cancel remaining tasks (optional)
        4. Return: Return successful result immediately

    Benefits:
        - +33% reliability (60% → 80% success rate)
        - Eliminates long-tail latency
        - Zero additional latency (parallel execution)
        - Production-grade fault tolerance

    Example:
        ```python
        executor = RedundantExecutor(num_copies=2)

        # Unreliable operation (30% failure rate)
        def fetch_data(query):
            if random.random() < 0.3:
                raise ConnectionError("Network timeout")
            return f"Data for '{query}'"

        result = executor.execute(fetch_data, "user profile")
        # 80% success rate vs 60% for single execution
        ```
