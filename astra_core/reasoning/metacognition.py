"""
Metacognition Module for STAN V41

Implements self-reflective reasoning - the system's ability to monitor,
evaluate, and improve its own reasoning processes.

Key capabilities:
- Reasoning quality assessment: Evaluate confidence, coherence, completeness
- Uncertainty monitoring: Track what the system doesn't know
- Error detection: Identify reasoning failures and biases
- Strategy selection: Choose appropriate reasoning strategies
- Learning from mistakes: Improve future reasoning based on past errors
