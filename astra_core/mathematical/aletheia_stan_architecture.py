"""
Aletheia-STAN Enhanced Architecture for Mathematical Proofs

This is an enhanced version of the Aletheia architecture that deeply integrates
STAN's advanced capabilities (V36-V100) to close the performance gap with
DeepMind's 95.1% accuracy on IMO-ProofBench Advanced.

Key Enhancements over basic Aletheia:
1. Ensemble Generator with multiple proof strategies
2. Multi-Stage Verification (LLM + symbolic + formal)
3. Adaptive Revision with strategic fix selection
4. Cross-problem learning and memory
5. Deep integration with STAN V80-V100 capabilities
