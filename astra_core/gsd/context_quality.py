Context Quality Monitoring Module
=================================

Monitors context window usage and degradation signals to ensure
consistent quality across long conversations.

This module implements GSD's context window management strategy:
- Track token usage
- Detect quality degradation
- Trigger context refresh when needed
- Manage subagent spawning for fresh context

Based on: https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done
