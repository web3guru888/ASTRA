Self-Consistency Engine: Multi-Sample Voting with Temperature Variation

Core concept: Generate N answers at different temperatures, then vote on the
most common answer. This improves accuracy by +3-5% on complex reasoning tasks.

Features:
- Temperature variation prevents mode collapse
- Confidence = fraction of samples agreeing
- Fallback to Chain-of-Thought if confidence < threshold
- Supports multiple answer types (multiple choice, exact match, open-ended)
