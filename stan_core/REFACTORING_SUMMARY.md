# stan_core Refactoring Complete ✅

**Date**: April 2026
**Branch**: `refactor/remove-version-numbers`
**Status**: Complete and Pushed to GitHub

---

## What Was Accomplished

Successfully refactored stan_core to remove confusing Vxxx version numbers, creating a coherent and professional structure that is much easier to navigate and understand.

### Scale of Refactoring

- **176 files changed**
- **6,375 insertions** (directory moves, __init__.py files)
- **96 deletions** (old paths)
- **4 major directories renamed**
- **36 capability files reorganized** into 9 logical subdirectories
- **Legacy systems archived** for future reference

---

## Key Changes

### Directory Structure Before → After

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `v7_autonomous_research/` | `autonomous_research/` |
| `v4_revolutionary/` | `revolutionary/` |
| `v5_discovery/` | `discovery_enhancement/` |
| `v100/` | `simulation/` |
| `core_legacy/` | `legacy_archives/systems/` |

### Capability Reorganization

**36 capability files** (previously named `vXX_name.py`) now organized by function:

```
capabilities/
├── causal/              (5 files) - Causal inference
├── discovery/            (6 files) - Discovery algorithms
├── learning/             (5 files) - Learning systems
├── cognitive/            (5 files) - Cognitive models
├── memory/               (1 file)  - Persistent memory
├── metacognitive/        (6 files) - Meta-cognitive functions
├── synthesis/            (4 files) - Synthesis engines
├── multimodal/           (2 files) - Multimodal processing
└── integration/          (2 files) - Integration capabilities
```

## Import Migration

### Old Style (Deprecated but Still Works)

```python
from stan_core.v7_autonomous_research import create_v7_scientist
from stan_core.capabilities.v50_causal_engine import CausalEngine
from stan_core.capabilities.v70_meta_scientific import MetaScientific
```

### New Style (Recommended)

```python
from stan_core.autonomous_research import create_scientist
from stan_core.capabilities.causal import CausalEngine
from stan_core.capabilities.metacognitive import MetaScientific
```

---

## Benefits

1. **No Version Confusion**: Clear, descriptive names instead of version numbers
2. **Logical Organization**: Capabilities grouped by function, not by version
3. **Professional Appearance**: Clean, coherent structure for users and contributors
4. **Easier Navigation**: Find what you need by category
5. **Better Scalability**: Easy to add new capabilities without version confusion
6. **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns across functional areas

## How to Migrate Your Code

### Quick Reference

If you have imports like:
```python
from stan_core.v7_autonomous_research import create_v7_scientist
```

Change to:
```python
from stan_core.autonomous_research import create_scientist
```

### All Import Mappings

| Old Import | New Import |
|------------|------------|
| `v7_autonomous_research` | `autonomous_research` |
| `v4_revolutionary` | `revolutionary` |
| `v50_causal_engine` | `capabilities/causal/causal_engine` |
| `v105_meta_discovery` | `capabilities/discovery/meta_discovery` |
| `v70_meta_scientific` | `capabilities/metacognitive/meta_scientific` |
| `v60_cognitive_agent` | `capabilities/cognitive/cognitive_agent` |
| `v50_meta_learner` | `capabilities/learning/meta_learner` |
| `v70_analogical_transfer` | `capabilities/synthesis/analogical_transfer` |
| `v102_counterfactual_engine` | `capabilities/synthesis/counterfactual_engine` |

See `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for complete mappings.
