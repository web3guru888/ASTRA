## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 What is ASTRA?

ASTRA (Autonomous Scientific Discovery in Astrophysics) is an integrated computational framework that combines numerical data analysis, causal reasoning, physical validation, and statistical inference to enable automated scientific discovery in astrophysics. Unlike traditional machine learning systems that detect patterns without understanding their physical meaning, or large language models that can explain concepts but cannot process numerical data, ASTRA integrates multiple analytical approaches to provide physically interpretable, validated scientific insights.

### 1.2 Key Design Principles

**Physics-Aware Reasoning**: All discoveries are validated against fundamental physical principles including conservation laws, dimensional consistency, and established theoretical frameworks.

**Causal Understanding**: ASTRA distinguishes between correlation and causation using structural causal models, enabling identification of physical mechanisms rather than mere associations.

**Uncertainty Quantification**: Every result includes properly propagated uncertainties, confidence intervals, and statistical significance assessments.

**Reproducibility**: All analyses are fully documented and reproducible, with complete provenance tracking from raw data to final conclusions.

**Modularity**: The system is organized into specialized components that can be used independently or combined for complex multi-step analyses.
